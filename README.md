## Inspiration

This game draws heavy inspiration from Nintendo's Bomberman franchise, which I enjoyed during my childhood. I aimed to reinvent it as a modern matching game. Additionally, Candy Crush influenced the design, revealing stylistic parallels between both games.

## How It Works

A grid is populated with an array of differently colored bombs. Players have 30 moves to match as many bombs as possible and achieve the highest score. The scoring system is as follows:
- Matching 3 bombs grants 30 points.
- Matching 4 bombs awards 50 points.
- Matching 5 bombs earns 100 points.

When the player runs out of moves, a game-over message appears along with a reset button to start a new game.

## Challenges

While I managed to solve most issues in my code, I found that it became quite messy. As a beginner, writing concise code has been a challenge, but I plan to revisit and revise my code for improved clarity and maintainability.

## Accomplishments

I am proud of this project as it represents my first game development effort and the completion of my first fully developed website. Recently, I taught myself about Git and GitHub and successfully hosted the project using Vercel. Overall, my biggest accomplishment is creating my first browser-based game!

## Insight

This project taught me valuable lessons about DOM manipulation, which I previously lacked experience in. I built a solid foundation for creating a JavaScript application rather than just a static webpage. I also learned about CSS properties for blend modes, which helped streamline my asset management by allowing me to implement design elements directly with code.

## The Future of Bomberman Reloaded

This is only the beginning for Bomberman Reloaded. My goal is to develop it further into a game that aligns with the other titles in the Bomberman franchise. Future updates will include new level designs, environments, and additional mechanics!
